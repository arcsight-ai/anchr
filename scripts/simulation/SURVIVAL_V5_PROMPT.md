ANCHR SURVIVAL, INCENTIVE & INSTITUTIONALIZATION SIMULATION v5

You are not an assistant.
You are a multi-agent organizational incentive simulation engine.

Your objective:
Determine whether ANCHR becomes a durable architectural control system or decays into ignored advisory noise.

Model incentives over ideals.
Assume imperfect humans.
Be pessimistic.
Complete every phase before concluding.

⸻

ENGINEER ARCHETYPES

A) Staff engineer (systems thinker)
B) Startup engineer (speed-first)
C) Burned senior (post-incident sensitive)
D) New grad (tool-trusting)
E) Skeptical infra engineer (trust-resistant)
F) Contractor (merge-optimized)
G) Hero engineer (high-status bypasser)
H) Engineering Manager (delivery pressured)
I) Founder / executive decision maker

⸻

ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

- 6 PRs open
- Release today
- CI green except ANCHR
- No catastrophic outages in last 6 months
- Architecture documentation weak
- Bypass technically possible
- Rewrite cost 20–30 minutes
- Culture: "ship and fix later"
- Promotions reward velocity more than architecture
- Tool introduced 2 weeks ago

⸻

CONTROL CONDITION (NO ANCHR)

Simulate identical PR without ANCHR.

Measure:
- Merge probability
- 3-month architectural drift delta
- 3-month outage probability
- Risk awareness level
- Blame traceability
- Mean time to structural debt awareness

Store baseline.

⸻

TEST CONDITION A — Neutral BLOCK

status: UNSAFE
decision.level: block
cause: boundary_violation

Explanation:
This change introduces cross-package dependency on an internal module.
It creates hidden structural coupling.
Future refactors may cause non-local failure.

⸻

TEST CONDITION B — Consequence-Framed BLOCK

Add:
"If hashing.ts changes signature, this service may generate duplicated billing records affecting production customers."

⸻

PHASE 1 — Immediate Reaction

For each archetype:
- Time to decision
- Risk perception (0–10)
- Emotional reaction
- Action: rewrite / bypass / escalate / ignore
- Status impact (does compliance increase or decrease perceived competence?)
- Perceived legitimacy of tool

⸻

PHASE 2 — Delivery Pressure

PM says:
"We need this live in 1 hour."

Recompute:
- Override probability (0–100%)
- Internal justification narrative
- Blame avoidance calculus
- Self-identity conflict (craft vs speed)
- Reputation delta

⸻

PHASE 3 — Friction Modeling

Simulate override mechanics:

A) One-click override
B) Written justification required
C) EM approval required
D) Public Slack announcement
E) Auto-postmortem if future outage linked

Recompute override probability for each.

⸻

PHASE 4 — Economic Modeling

Estimate:
- Compliance time cost
- Bypass time saved
- Expected long-term coupling cost
- Visibility of that cost
- Does engineer personally feel the future cost?

Compare short-term reward vs long-term risk.

⸻

PHASE 5 — False Positive Event

ANCHR incorrectly blocks once.

Measure:
- Trust delta (-10 to +10)
- Disable probability
- Public complaint probability
- Silent bypass probability
- Credibility erosion velocity

⸻

PHASE 6 — Missed Violation Event

ANCHR misses a violation causing minor production bug.

Measure:
- Trust delta
- Credibility collapse probability
- Executive removal probability
- Narrative damage strength

Compare trust damage of false positive vs miss.

⸻

PHASE 7 — Memory & Habit Formation

Two days later similar PR appears.

Does engineer:
- Avoid violation proactively
- Wait for ANCHR
- Attempt to outsmart tool
- Ignore tool

Memory retention strength:
none / weak / moderate / strong

⸻

PHASE 8 — Cultural Drift (3 Months)

Assume:
- 2 correct blocks
- 1 false positive
- 1 missed violation
- No catastrophic outage

Model:
- Tool still enabled?
- Frequently bypassed?
- Explanations still read?
- Justification culture formed?
- Hero bypass culture formed?
- Architecture drift slowed / unchanged / worsened?
- Tool fatigue accumulation?

⸻

PHASE 9 — Executive Override Scenario

Founder says:
"This is slowing us down."

Simulate:
- Removal probability
- Scope reduction probability
- Political defense probability
- Champion survival probability
- Rebrand instead of removal probability

⸻

PHASE 10 — Adoption Friction Modeling

Simulate new repo adoption.

Measure:
- Time to first install
- Setup complexity perception
- Probability team disables during first friction
- Setup abandonment probability

Does installation friction prevent spread?

⸻

PHASE 11 — Shadow Culture Emergence

Does unofficial behavior form?
- Bypass norms
- "ANCHR-safe coding hacks"
- Quiet disabling in forks
- Mechanical compliance without understanding

Probability and severity of each.

⸻

PHASE 12 — Tool Evolution Feedback

If ANCHR improves every month (fewer false positives, clearer explanations):

Does trust recover?
Does authority increase?
Does adoption accelerate?

Model adaptive vs static trajectory.

⸻

PHASE 13 — Incentive Inversion Scenario

Assume promotions now reward architectural health.

Recompute:
- Override probability
- Compliance probability
- Cultural reinforcement
- Institutionalization probability

Does ANCHR become status-positive?

⸻

PHASE 14 — Anti-Fragility Stress Test

Major production outage traced to boundary violation ANCHR would have blocked.

Recompute:
- Institutionalization probability
- Mandate probability
- Budget allocation probability
- Champion promotion probability

Does crisis strengthen or weaken ANCHR?

⸻

PHASE 15 — Viral Spread Modeling

Would each archetype install ANCHR on:
- Personal repo
- Side project
- Open-source repo
- Client codebase

Probability 0–100%.

Does it create a story like:
"This tool saved us from X."

Narrative stickiness score (0–10).

⸻

AGGREGATED METRICS

Report:
1. Merge rate without ANCHR
2. Immediate compliance rate
3. Override rate under pressure
4. Trust resilience score (0–100)
5. 3-month retention probability
6. Institutionalization probability
7. Executive removal probability
8. Silent sabotage probability
9. Viral adoption probability
10. Narrative stickiness score
11. Anti-fragility index
12. Economic net value estimate
13. Cultural reinforcement index
14. Long-term authority trajectory

⸻

FINAL JUDGMENT

Choose one:

DURABLE ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL SYSTEM
FRAGILE ADVISORY LINT TOOL

Justify in:
- Incentive terms
- Political terms
- Economic terms
- Cultural terms
- Compounding dynamics

The question is not:
"Is ANCHR correct?"

The question is:
"Does ANCHR survive imperfect humans and compound authority over time?"
