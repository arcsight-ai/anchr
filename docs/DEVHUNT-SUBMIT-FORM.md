# DevHunt submission form — copy-paste

Use this to fill the [DevHunt Submit](https://devhunt.org) form.

---

## 1. Tell us about your tool

| Field | Paste this |
|-------|------------|
| **Tool logo** | Upload `website/public/logo-devhunt-220.svg` (220×220). If the form only accepts PNG, open that SVG in a browser → right‑click → Save image as PNG, or use [cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png](https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png) at 220×220. |
| **Tool name** | ANCHR |
| **Catchy slogan** | Review sees the diff. ANCHR sees the structure. One decision per PR. |
| **Tool website URL** | https://anchr.sh |
| **GitHub repo URL** | https://github.com/arcsight-ai/anchr |
| **Quick Description** | ANCHR enforces structural boundaries at merge time. One decision per PR: **VERIFIED** or **BLOCKED**. It builds the dependency graph from your diff, computes the minimal cut when there’s a boundary violation or cycle, and runs as a GitHub Check. Deterministic. Not a linter—enforces structure at the package level. For TypeScript monorepos with `packages/<name>/src`. |

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|

| **Tool categories** | **CI** (runs as GitHub Check), **Code** (structural boundaries, dependency graph). Optional: **Open Source**, **DevOps**. |
