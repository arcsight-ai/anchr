## OpenGraph Image (Locked)

**Layout:** 1200×630. Centered text.

## Ranked Alternatives (Reference Only)

**Hero runners-up:**  
2. "Architecture Is Too Important to Leave to Convention." (philosophical)  
3. "One Decision Per PR." (brutal minimal)

**OG runners-up:**  
B. "One Decision Per PR. VERIFIED or BLOCKED." + ANCHR footer  
C. "Architecture Is Not A Suggestion." + ANCHR — Structural Gate

Launch uses Hero Option 1 and OG Option A. Do not switch unless critical.
