# ArcSight certification + repair comment (safe for pull_request_target).
# Copy to .github/workflows/anchr.yml and adjust as needed.
#
# This workflow runs on the base branch; it never executes PR code.
# Certification runs on the PR checkout; the comment step only reads
# artifacts/anchr-report.json and GITHUB_EVENT_PATH.
